c     This code uses the fft99f.f two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform routine.  The version
c      that has been used for the published calculations with this code was obtained from
c      dsl@ncar.ucar.edu on Monday 9 September 1991 and contains the following history comments:
C      PACKAGE FFT99F HISTORY:
C              THE PACKAGE WAS WRITTEN BY CLIVE TEMPERTON AT ECMWF IN
C              NOVEMBER, 1978.  IT WAS MODIFIED, DOCUMENTED, AND TESTED
C              FOR NCAR BY RUSS REW IN SEPTEMBER, 1980.

c    Original source and previous modifications
c
c     The two-layer quasi-geostrophic model code that is the original source for this code
c      was written by R. M. Samelson to perform the calculations described by:
c       Samelson, R. M., and J. Pedlosky, 1990. Local baroclinic instability of flow over
c         variable topography. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 221, 411-436.
c       Oh, S. P., J. Pedlosky, and R. M. Samelson, 1993. Linear and finite-amplitude localized
c         baroclinic instability. Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 50(16), 2772-2784.
c
c     This version has been modified by Karl Helfrich from
c     the original code written by Roger Samelson.
c     KRH 10/92
c
c	  The Roberts scheme for controlling the saw-tooth
c	  computational instability has been added.
c	  KRH 11-12-92
c
c     This version has friction in the from of
c     a hyperviscosity = -r del^6 psi_n
